# Final project

## Resources

See `final-project/data` for data resources, and individual `example-*` for demonstrations of specific techniques and visualization types.

Please also be sure to thoroughly review the data manipulation techniques discussed in weeks 3 and 4, particularly `array.filter`, `array.map`, and `array.forEach`, and `d3.nest`.

The following content was not covered in class, but you should be able to easily understand them by reading the API reference:
- `d3.map` ([API](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#map))

## Submission and grading

The final project submission deadline is **Dec 15, end of day**. 

Please submit your work via Github. To commit and upload your work to Github, follow these steps:

Navigate to course root directory, and in terminal, type in:
```
git add --all
git commit -m "Some commit message of your choice"
git push origin master
```

If you encounter any issues, please contact me via Slack or email.

## Grading rubric

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| On-time submission  | 5%  |
| Coding style  | 5%  |
| Design  | 45%  |
| Technical competence  | 45%  |

### Coding style
Does the code follow good coding conventions (such as variable naming, use of semicolons etc.)? Is it properly formatted with correct indentations?

### Design
- Do the design choices (such as the choice of visualization type) facilitate the understanding of underlying data? Do they in anyway misrepresent the data?
- Color, typography, layout

### Technical competence
- Demonstrate a clear understanding of the data visualization pipeline (acquisition, transformation, representation).
- Demonstrate a high-level of comfort with object and array manipulation.
- Demonstrate a clear understanding of data-DOM binding, and correctly use the enter / exit / update pattern.
- Demonstrate a clear understanding of functions and function scope, and correctly use functions to structure the code.
- Demonstrate facility with basic interaction techniques, including at least one of the following: tooltips, dynamic refresh.
